Density-Based Dynamic Traffic Signal Simulation is a smart traffic control system that adjusts signal timings based on real-time vehicle density. It dynamically allocates green light duration to reduce congestion, waiting time, and fuel usage, ensuring smoother traffic flow and efficient intersection management.
